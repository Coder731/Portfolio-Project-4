- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

##### Correct:
##### easy to match operators with operands

```
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction
          - student_loan_interest)
```

In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth’s style is suggested.
