### The Operators:


#### x << y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.
#### x >> y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as //'ing x by 2**y.
#### x & y
Does a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.
#### x | y
Does a "bitwise or". Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it's 1.
#### ~ x
Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as -x - 1.
#### x ^ y
Does a "bitwise exclusive or". Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit in y is 0, and it's the complement of the bit in x if that bit in y is 1.

```
Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are the special symbols that carry out arithmetic and logical computations. The value the operator operates on is known as Operand.

```
Most of the bitwise operators are binary, which means that they expect two operands to work with, typically referred to as the left operand and the right operand. Bitwise NOT ( ~ ) is the only unary bitwise operator since it expects just one operand.
