## Branch Bug [Resolved]
Accidentally opened GitPod from the User Story section of GitHub, and then committed from this repository which git classed as a side branch.
Solution:
- Merged with main
- GitHub advised that this branch can be safely deleted
- Deleted side branch to avoid confusion with main branch
- Option is present to restore side branch.
